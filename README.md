# NLP Experiments

# `This is attempt #2 at doing this you can see my first try` [here](https://github.com/ivanrj7j/NLP-Failed1)

## Introduction

Welcome to our experimental NLP project, where we boldly challenge the limits of language and AI. This project is a thrilling journey into uncharted territories of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We're redefining language understanding using innovative word vectorization techniques and groundbreaking NLP models. It's an experimental odyssey where unconventional ideas thrive.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Experimental Word Vectorization 🧠

In the first phase, we explore innovative approaches to word vectorization, aiming to create a new dimension in language understanding. We're experimenting with various techniques. The goal is to uncover novel ways to represent words and their relations.

### Phase 2: Trailblazing NLP Models 🤖

In the second phase, we venture into uncharted waters, conducting experiments in sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER). 

### Phase 3: Trailblazing Comparative Analysis 📈

In the final phase, we rigorously compare the results of our experimental models and vectorization techniques. We evaluate their performance, efficiency, and effectiveness. The comparative analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our experimental approaches.

## Getting Started 🚀

If you're as excited as we are about experimental NLP, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivanrj7j/NLP
   ```

2. Set up your development environment and explore our daring experiments.

3. Document your findings, share your insights, and join the experimental journey.

## Project Structure 📂

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Store your dataset and preprocessed data.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for our experimental models and the word vectorizer.
- `models/`: This is where we save our experimental model checkpoints and configurations.
- `experiments/`: Dive into the heart of our experiments here, contribute, and explore the unconventional.
- `failed experiments/`: Dont't just see my W's, you also got to see my L's with my experiments.
- `failed src/`: Dont't just see my W's, you also got to see my L's with my source code.
